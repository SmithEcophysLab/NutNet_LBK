## March 30, 2019
- Fertilized plots

## June 27, 2019
- Tyler put collars in each plot and began soil respiration measurements
- Nick took LAI data
- core data plot for plots 34 and 35 had to be modified as soil collars were put in these plots
(totally Nick's fault!)

## October 6, 2019
- harvest day
- clipped and bagged biomass
	- went "west to east"
	- marked northwest corner of each strip with a flag
- measured community composition
- measured light interception
- Laennecia was mostly fully senesced
- other species senesced as well
- Brassicacea identified as *Descurainia pinnata*
- may be wise to harvest earlier next year

## April 26, 2020
- fertilized plots
- lots of flowering plants >> maybe think about a Spring sampling
	- nothing new, but much easier IDing
	
## September 19, 2020
- harvest day
- clipped and bagged biomass
	- went "west to east"
	- marked northwest corner of each strip with a flag
- measured community composition
- measured light interception
- measured plant height outside of plots for add-on experiment
- most things still green, but this is as about as late as harvest should be

## September 27, 2020
- measured height of *Descurainia pinnata* (missed previous week)

## April 10, 2021
- fertilized plots
- very few green plants (wait until end of month/beginning of May for spring sampling?)

## September 11, 2021
- took annual biomass samples from blocks 1 and 2
- took annual community composition
- took height on 10 individuals of all species
- took annual light measurements
- composition, light, and height measurements saved to Epicollect
- **COMMON LARGE ANNUAL IS CHENOPODIUM INCANUM - per R. Cox***

## September 18, 2021
- took ~300-400 g of soil from the biomass strips in each plot

## October 26, 2021
- sent soil samples to U Oklahoma (Jialiang Kuang and Daliang Ning)
