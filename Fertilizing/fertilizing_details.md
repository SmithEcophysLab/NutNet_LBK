# Fertilizing details for NutNet LBK site
Fertilizer has been applied at the NutNet LBK site each Spring 
starting in 2019 (see [log](../Log/nutnet_lbb_log.md)).
**Importantly: from 2019-2023 fertilizer amounts were slightly different
from the main NutNet protocol. From 2024 on, the numbers have been corrected.**

## Summary
**Fifteen bags each of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, and Micronutrient mix
need to be filled to cover all 30 plots. The size of each bag is:**

Nitrogen: **568 grams** per bag of slow release urea

Phosphorus: **1245 grams** per bag of Triple Super Phosphate

Potassium: **558 grams** per bag of Sulphate of Potash

Micronutrients: **2500 grams**  per bag of Everris Micromax (*only applied in 2019*)

### Incorrect 2019-2023 summary
Nitrogen: 588 per bag of slow release urea (**20 grams too much per plot per year**)

Phosphorus: 543.5 per bag of Triple Super Phosphate (**701.5 grams too little per plot per year**)

Potassium: 558 grams per bag of Sulphate of Potash (**58 grams too little per plot per year**)

## Rationale

### Nitrogen
Slow release urea nitrogen was received from Alan Gerber (Nutrien),
a local sales rep.

The nitrogen in 44-0-0. This means that the application rate is 22.7
g m<sup>-2</sup>. 

This amounts to 568 grams per plot (plot size = 25 m<sup>2</sup>).

### Phosophorus
Phosphorus was obtained as Triple Super Phosphate from seedworld.com.
A local retailer could not be identified.

The phosphorus is 0-46-0. This means that the application rate is 49.8
g m<sup>-2</sup>. 

This amounts to 1245 grams per plot (plot size = 25 m<sup>2</sup>).

### Potassium
Phosphorus was obtained as Sulphate of Potash from seedworld.com.
A local retailer could not be identified.

The phosphorus is 0-0-50. This means that the application rate is 22.3
g m<sup>-2</sup>. 

This amounts to 558 grams per plot (plot size = 25 m<sup>2</sup>).

### Micronutrient Mix
Phosphorus was obtained as Everris Micromax Micronutient Fertilizer from seedworld.com.
A local retailer could not be identified.

The fertilizer is 6% Ca, 3% Mg,12%S, 0.1% B, 1% Cu, 17% Fe, 2.5% Mn, 0.05% Mo, 1% Zn.


This is added as 2500 grams per plot (to K plots only), per the NutNet protocol.
