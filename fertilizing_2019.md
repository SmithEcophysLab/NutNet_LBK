# Fertilizing details for 2019 season

## Summary
**Fifteen bags each of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, and Micronutrient mix
need to be filled to cover all 30 plots. The size of each bag is:**

Nitrogen: **588 grams** per bag of slow release urea

Phosphorus: **543.5 grams** per bag of Triple Super Phosphate

Potassium: **500 grams** per bag of Sulphate of Potash

Micronutrients: **2500 grams**  per bag of Everris Micromax

## Rationale

### Nitrogen
Slow release urea nitrogen was received from Alan Gerber (Nutrien),
a local sales rep.

The nitrogen in 44-0-0. This means that the application rate is 22.7
g m<sup>-2</sup>. 

This amounts to 588 grams per plot (plot size = 25 m<sup>2</sup>).

### Phosophorus
Phosphorus was obtained as Triple Super Phosphate from seedworld.com.
A local retailer could not be identified.

The phosphorus is 0-46-0. This means that the application rate is 21.7
g m<sup>-2</sup>. 

This amounts to 543.5 grams per plot (plot size = 25 m<sup>2</sup>).

### Potassium
Phosphorus was obtained as Sulphate of Potash from seedworld.com.
A local retailer could not be identified.

The phosphorus is 0-0-50. This means that the application rate is 20
g m<sup>-2</sup>. 

This amounts to 500 grams per plot (plot size = 25 m<sup>2</sup>).

### Micronutrient Mix
Phosphorus was obtained as Everris Micromax Micronutient Fertilizer from seedworld.com.
A local retailer could not be identified.

The fertilizer is 6% Ca, 3% Mg,12%S, 0.1% B, 1% Cu, 17% Fe, 2.5% Mn, 0.05% Mo, 1% Zn.


This is added as 2500 grams per plot (to K plots only), per the NutNet protocol.
